# Linked Lists

This is a common data structure where you have nodes linked between them (insert animation). The usual operations for linked lists are:

- **Add Node:** Append a new node at the fron of the head of the list.
- **Insert Node:** Insert a new node given a list's index.
- **Remove Node:** Remove a node given the node's value.

Here you can see the linked list implementation for different programming languages:

- [C Implementation](./c/linkedList.c) and [interactive use](./c/main.c)
