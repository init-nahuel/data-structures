# Linked Lists

This is a common data structure where you have nodes linked between them (insert animation). The usual operations for linked lists are:

- **Add Node**
- **Insert Node**
- **Remove Node**

Here you can see the linked list implementation for different programming languages:

- [C Implementation](./c/linkedList.c) and [interactive use](./c/main.c)

## Add Node

This operation append a new node at the front of the head of the list.

As you can see it is possible to insert repetitive values on a linked list without problem.
